    "ft_text = '''A Russian cyber espionage unit has hacked Iranian hackers to lead attacks in more than 35 countries, a joint UK and US investigation has revealed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The so-called Turla group, which has been linked with Russian intelligence, allegedly hijacked the tools of Oilrig, a group widely linked to the Iranian government, according to a two-year probe by the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre in collaboration with the US’ National Security Agency. The NCSC is part of GCHQ, the digital intelligence agency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Iranian group is most likely unaware that its hacking methods have been hacked and deployed by another cyber espionage team, security officials involved in the investigation said. Victims include military establishments, government departments, scientific organisations and universities across the world, mainly in the Middle East.\n",
    "\n",
    "Paul Chichester, NCSC director of operations, said Turla’s activity represented “a real change in the modus operandi of cyber actors” which he said “added to the sense of confusion” over which state-backed cyber groups had been responsible for successful attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The reason we are [publicising] this is because of the different tradecraft we are seeing Turla use,” he told reporters. “We want others to be able to understand this activity.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr Chichester described how Turla began “piggybacking” on Oilrig’s attacks by monitoring an Iranian hack closely enough to use the same backdoor route into an organisation or to gain access to the resulting intelligence. Turla is also known as Waterbug or Venomous Bear.\n",
    "\n",

       "'A Russian cyber espionage unit has hacked Iranian hackers to lead attacks in more than 35 countries, a joint UK and US investigation has revealed.\\n\\nThe so-called Turla group, which has been linked with Russian intelligence, allegedly hijacked the tools of Oilrig, a group widely linked to the Iranian government, according to a two-year probe by the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre in collaboration with the US’ National Security Agency. The NCSC is part of GCHQ, the digital intelligence agency.\\n\\nThe Iranian group is most likely unaware that its hacking methods have been hacked and deployed by another cyber espionage team, security officials involved in the investigation said. Victims include military establishments, government departments, scientific organisations and universities across the world, mainly in the Middle East.\\n\\nPaul Chichester, NCSC director of operations, said Turla’s activity represented “a real change in the modus operandi of cyber actors” which he said “added to the sense of confusion” over which state-backed cyber groups had been responsible for successful attacks.\\n\\n“The reason we are [publicising] this is because of the different tradecraft we are seeing Turla use,” he told reporters. “We want others to be able to understand this activity.”\\n\\nMr Chichester described how Turla began “piggybacking” on Oilrig’s attacks by monitoring an Iranian hack closely enough to use the same backdoor route into an organisation or to gain access to the resulting intelligence. Turla is also known as Waterbug or Venomous Bear.\\n\\nBut the Russian group then progressed to initiating their own attacks using Oilrig’s command-and-control infrastructure and software. Organisations in approximately 20 countries were successfully hacked in this way.\\n\\n“[Turla] could benefit from the operations of Oilrig.

       "'HONG KONG — For the second day in a row, thousands rallied on Sunday in Hong Kong to protest mob violence and what they say is police brutality against peaceful marchers. And for the second consecutive day, the police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at the throngs.On Saturday, riot police officers unleashed pepper spray and rubber bullets and clashed briefly with demonstrators in a train station in a northern town. Barely 24 hours later, clashes erupted again that turned parts of downtown Hong Kong into a tear gas-filled battlefield as riot officers beat back demonstrators who tried to approach the Chinese government’s representative office in the territory.The police on Sunday fired dozens of rounds of tear gas starting from about 7 p.m. and charged protesters, sending hundreds of bystanders who were watching nearby scrambling for shelter. Groups of riot officers with clubs chased black-clad protesters down alleys in the dense urban district.In some areas, as the police sought to disperse the demonstrators, they beat them with batons and shields, pressed them to the ground and cuffed them. Some protesters appeared injured. The police said protesters had thrown bricks and other hard objects as they charged police lines.“I am really shocked,” said Isaac Chan, a lawyer who lives near the liaison office, saying he was upset about the police response and the use of tear gas.Mr. Chan, 36, said he supported the protesters but had not participated in any demonstrations. “It is complete violence by the police,” he said. “Ridiculous.”This was the third straight weekend that violent clashes had broken out since the demonstrations began nearly two months ago over an unpopular bill, since shelved, that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. Since then, the demonstrations have grown into almost daily public displays of vitriol against the police, Hong Kong’s leaders and the government in Beijing, throwing Hong Kong into its worst political crisis since it was returned to Chinese rule in 1997.The chaos on Sunday unfolded across several districts, moving from the Police Headquarters to a major shopping area and then near the central government’s offices in the west. Many shops locked their doors early and rolled down steel barriers. Streets were emptied after the police pushed back protesters, and cars slowly navigated around protester barriers left in the roads. Tourists and residents turned onto streets filled with tear gas, only to retreat coughing and with eyes burning.The police, armed with full-length shields, helmets, batons and gas masks and backed by lines of police vans with sirens blaring, formed tight rows several yards across from the protesters, who wore helmets and gas masks and formed their own line with makeshift shields fashioned from street signs they had ripped off, umbrellas and trash bins. The police sent out advisories warning residents living in affected neighborhoods to keep their windows shut because tear gas would be deployed.Hong Kong’s embattled leader, Carrie Lam, has come under pressure from Beijing to restore order in the territory. In addition to the full withdrawal of the extradition bill, protesters have demanded an expansion of direct elections and an independent investigation into police use of force.Mrs. Lam, who suspended the extradition bill, has refused to make any further concessions to the protesters and appears confident her administration can wait out the protest movement despite the escalating violence.The authorities had banned marches in the city this weekend, citing concerns of violence, but that did not stop protesters from turning out on Saturday in Yuen Long, a satellite town where a mob had attacked demonstrators a week earlier. The protesters on Sunday also ignored a police ban against marching to the western part of Hong Kong Island.The last stop of the banned march on Sunday was supposed to be close to the central government’s representative office. As a symbol of Communist Party rule, the office has for years been a target of the pro-democracy movement that has sought to fight what it denounces as the erosion of freedoms that set Hong Kong apart from the rest of China.But on Sunday, after gathering downtown, thousands of protesters unexpectedly started marching in the opposite direction of the liaison office. No police officers were seen until the crowd reached Police Headquarters, where a handful of officers appeared behind barriers as hundreds of protesters shouted slogans outside.The protesters filled Hennessy Road, the center of a major shopping district in the Causeway Bay district, and began building barriers from sidewalk railings.Hundreds more headed toward the liaison office about three miles away, where they faced off against riot police defending the building, and threw things at the officers. The officers fired tear gas and shouted warnings that the protesters were participating in an illegal gathering.The police said that some protesters had set ablaze a cart and pushed it toward a police cordon. “Police condemn the protesters’ escalating violence and appeal to everyone at scene to stay calm,” the government said in a statement.The police said early Monday that 49 people had been arrested on charges including unauthorized assembly and possession of an offensive weapon.Before the protest on Sunday, workers had erected barriers around the liaison office and glued down nearby pavement stones to prevent them from being dug up and hurled by demonstrators.Protesters had defaced the liaison office a week ago, painting slogans and throwing eggs and ink at a crest of the Chinese state. That vandalism set off days of vociferous denunciations from Chinese officials.A statement from the authorities in Beijing said the actions “openly challenged the authority of the central government.” On Wednesday, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of National Defense cited the damage to the liaison office when he warned that the military could be called upon to quell unrest in Hong Kong.In recent days, protesters have also been angered by reports that one of the central government office’s district staffers had given a speech in Yuen Long urging residents to drive out demonstrators.Last weekend, a group of men, including some accused of having connections with the gangs known as triads, assaulted protesters and others in a Yuen Long train station. At least 45 people were injured.The liaison office has dismissed alleged links to the Yuen Long violence as “malicious rumors.” But it is facing increasing scrutiny over its role in Hong Kong, which is a semiautonomous part of China that has operated under a model of “one country, two systems” since its 1997 return from British control.On Saturday, tens of thousands of protesters marched in Yuen Long and some tried to set up barricades near villages. Riot police officers fired rubber bullets and tear gas, and clashes broke out. Thirteen people were arrested, including the organizer.Prohibitions on protests are generally rare in Hong Kong, but they have been used in the past two days as the authorities try to contain the unrest.Weeks of protests have also exacerbated divisions between government leaders and some of the rank-and-file police officers assigned to confrontational protests. Police associations denounced the No. 2 official in Hong Kong, Matthew Cheung, after he apologized on Friday for the authorities’ failure to stop the Yuen Long mob attack.'"

       "'HONG KONG — Southeast Asian countries tend to be deeply reluctant to collectively challenge China’s growing military and economic prowess in their region. But this week, they appear to be doing just that — by holding their first joint naval drills with the United States Navy.The drills, which will take place partly in the South China Sea, a site of geopolitical tension, began on Monday. They were not expected to focus on lethal maneuvers, or to take place in contested waters where China operates military bases.But the maneuvers follow similar exercises held last year by China and the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations in an undisputed area of the sea, making them a riposte of sorts to Beijing.During a summer of heightened tensions over territorial claims, plus an escalating trade war between China and the United States, the drills are being closely watched as the latest move in a high-stakes geopolitical chess match between the superpowers and their shared regional allies.Some analysts see the drills as part of an incremental hardening of America’s military posture in the South China Sea under President Trump, a strategy that has not been accompanied by additional American diplomacy or incentives for its partners.“The United States is taking a risk both that its partners will be less inclined to work with it because they are nervous about signaling security cooperation when there’s nothing else there, and that China will continue to advance in the places in which we are absent” on diplomatic and economic fronts, said Mira Rapp-Hooper, an expert on Asian security affairs at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.“So from a basic balance-of-power perspective, we are not holding the line nearly as well as we should be,” she added.The United States Navy declined to comment on the record ahead of the drills, citing operational sensitivities.But in a statement late Sunday, the Navy said the drills would include “a sea phase in international waters in Southeast Asia, including the Gulf of Thailand and South China Sea.” It said they would focus partly on “search and seizure,” “maritime asset tracking” and “countering maritime threats,” among other subjects.The statement said the drills would include eight warships, four aircraft and more than 1,000 personnel. It said the American military hardware included a littoral combat ship, a guided-missile destroyer, three MH-60 helicopters and a P-8 Poseidon plane.The Poseidon is a type of reconnaissance aircraft that the United States has used to conduct surveillance flights over the South China Sea, including around disputed reefs that China has filled out and turned into military bases.The drills were scheduled to begin on Monday at Sattahip, a Thai naval base, after “pre-sail activities in Thailand, Singapore and Brunei,” and to end in Singapore. The Navy’s statement did not say when the drills would end.Many of the drills will take place this week off Ca Mau Province, on the southern tip of Vietnam, said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a Thai political analyst. He added that the drills would “reinforce the view that geopolitical tensions are shifting from land to sea.”The timing is ideal for Vietnam, which is deeply worried about a state-owned Chinese survey ship that has been spotted this summer in what the Vietnamese regard as their own territorial waters. Last month, the State Department called the survey ship’s movements an effort by Beijing to “intimidate other claimants out of developing resources in the South China Sea,” including what it said was $2.5 trillion worth of unexploited oil and natural gas.“Vietnam should be happy” that the drills are taking place given China’s recent “aggression in its waters,” said Luc Anh Tuan, a researcher at the University of New South Wales in Australia.“Hanoi nevertheless will manage to downplay the significance of the drill because like other ASEAN fellows, it does not want to create an impression of a coalition against China,” added Mr. Tuan, who is on educational leave from the Vietnamese Ministry of Public Security.The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry confirmed in an email last week that the drills were happening, but declined to answer other questions.Beijing’s actions in the sea are hugely sensitive for Hanoi because it is under heavy domestic pressure to be tough on China, its largest trading partner and former colonial occupier. But Vietnam is also racing to find new energy sources to power its fast-growing economy.In a sign of those tensions, there were rare anti-Chinese riots in Vietnam in 2014, after a state-owned Chinese company defiantly towed an oil rig into disputed waters near the Vietnamese coast, prompting a tense maritime standoff. Three years later, Vietnam suspended a gas-drilling project in the sea by a subsidiary of a Spanish company because the project was said to have irritated Beijing.Yan Yan, an expert on maritime law at the National Institute for South China Sea Studies, on Hainan Island off the Chinese mainland, said that this week’s drills reflected Washington’s “concern and anxiety” about waning American influence in the region. She said the drills were not a cause for concern for Beijing, which she said planned to eventually expand the “subjects and scope” of its own naval drills with ASEAN.“If we take a long view of these countries’ relations with the United States, we’d know that they are actually very wary of it,” Ms. Yan said.But ASEAN countries will be more concerned about China’s reaction to the drills than they were about the American reaction to last year’s drills with China, said Gregory B. Poling, an expert on Southeast Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. He said that was especially true for countries, such as Thailand, that had no territorial disputes in the sea with China.“They don’t want to do it in a way that upsets the apple cart” of trade with China, he said of the Thai authorities. The Thai Navy declined to comment.The United States Navy said in its statement that its joint naval drills with ASEAN were first proposed in 2017 and confirmed last October. That is the same month that China held its first joint naval drills with ASEAN, off its southern coast.In a telephone interview, Kasit Piromya, a former Thai foreign minister, downplayed the risks for ASEAN of holding naval drills with the United States. “From Thailand’s point of view, it’s still an open sea,” he said, adding that any such exercises with any outside partner should be neither aggressive nor defensive.But Beijing’s territorial claims in the sea have no legal basis, he added, echoing the conclusion of an international tribunal that ruled against China three years ago. He said a key question now was whether Southeast Asian leaders could summon the “guts” to confront China’s construction of artificial islands and military bases in the sea, even though some of them have been “kowtowing to Chinese pressures and financial generosity.”“I would urge the ASEAN leaders, the 10 of them, to get together and speak in a black-and-white manner to the Chinese leadership without being blackmailed or bought out by China’s financial offers,” he said.'"

       "'Hardcore pro-democracy protesters left a trail of havoc and destruction across Hong Kong on Sunday, marching in defiance of a police ban and targeting government buildings and subway stations with vandalism.\\nThe day’s violence, which began with masked demonstrators hurling petrol bombs and smashing windows at Admiralty and Wan Chai stations marked the 15th straight weekend that protests have gripped the city and raised questions over how the Asian financial hub’s future will be shaped.\\nThe economic effects of the three-month crisis were brought into sharp focus on Sunday when Hong Kong International Airport released figures showing it had seen its biggest monthly drop in passengers for a decade in August as the protests prompted tourist and business visitors to cancel trips.\\nFew see any signs of an imminent return to calm. “We are never going to back down before Beijing does,” said one 28-year-old protester who gave his name as Peter. “We have fought for 100 days now. What makes anyone think we will give up now?”\\nLittle has been done to mitigate the anger that underlies the demonstrations. Protesters complain of the difficulty in getting affordable housing. The recent offer by Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, to withdraw a bill that would have allowed extradition to mainland China of suspects in Hong Kong, was widely described by demonstrators as “too little, too late”.\\nThe grim prospects for many young Hong Kongers has caused some to speculate that the focus of protests might at some point shift towards the tycoons whose influence has defined Hong Kong’s development.\\nOn Saturday, separate editorials in three Chinese state-owned media outlets criticised the Hong Kong property tycoons, suggesting that Hong Kong authorities seize undeveloped land and use it to build more housing. The People’s Daily in particular demanded that the landowners show their sincerity instead of “hoarding land for profit and earning every last penny”.\\nThe editorial came in response to recent comments by Hong Kong’s richest man, Li Ka-shing, who said that the city’s young people were the “masters of our future” and remains a hero to many of the protesters. “Most HK people believe Li Ka-shing is pro democracy but the other tycoons are all in it for the money and they are trying to stay quiet and do whatever Beijing tells them to do,” said Roy, 30, a freelance artist among the protesters on Sunday. “Most of these tycoons bear responsibility for helping real estate prices rocket into space.”\\nThe violence around the Admiralty area, which includes the government headquarters, erupted suddenly on an afternoon that had just an hour earlier seen families and tourists shopping and dining in the upmarket Pacific Place shopping mall across the road. By early evening bonfires of dustbins and cardboard boxes blazed at the station’s entrances as the mob stormed towards the busy Wan Chai and Causeway Bay districts.\\nRiot police met the protests with force, volleying tear gas into the crowds and deploying water cannons into the avenues that run alongside the Hong Kong offices of some of the world’s biggest financial institutions.\\nBy nightfall, clashes between protesters and police had descended into outbreaks of fighting between rival groups of Hong Kong residents as tensions flared between pro-democracy supporters and pro-Beijing groups. As the protests have evolved, pro-democracy groups have increasingly clashed with small pockets of opponents. On Saturday, brawling between the rival mobs left dozens of people badly bloodied.'"
